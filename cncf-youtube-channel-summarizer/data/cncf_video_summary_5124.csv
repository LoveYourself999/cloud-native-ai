The talk by [Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_I._Jordan_(computer_scientist)) at the [2018 Data Science Conference](https://datasciencecon.com/speakers/michael-i-jordan/) focuses on the limitations of current data science methods and the need for a more comprehensive approach. Jordan argues that data science is not just about data, algorithms, and models, but also about understanding the underlying phenomena that generate the data. He emphasizes the importance of incorporating domain knowledge into data science and advocates for a more interdisciplinary approach to data science education.

Jordan identifies several challenges in data science, including the lack of standardization in data formats and the need for better tools for data integration and curation. He also highlights the importance of interpretability and transparency in data science, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance.

Jordan also discusses the limitations of deep learning, a popular machine learning technique. He notes that deep learning models can be highly effective at making predictions, but they are often difficult to interpret and can be prone to overfitting. Jordan argues that a more holistic approach to data science, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods, can help address these limitations.

Key technologies mentioned in the talk include machine learning, deep learning, and data integration and curation tools. Jordan also highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge and interdisciplinary perspectives into data science.

The talk concludes with a call to action for the data science community to adopt a more interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to data science, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods and emphasizing interpretability and transparency.

Critical questions or answers highlighted in the talk include:

* How can we incorporate domain knowledge and interdisciplinary perspectives into data science?
* What are the limitations of deep learning, and how can we address these limitations?
* How can we improve data integration and curation tools to support more effective data science?
* How can we ensure interpretability and transparency in data science, particularly in high-stakes applications?

In summary, the talk by Michael Jordan emphasizes the importance of a more interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach to data science, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative","
