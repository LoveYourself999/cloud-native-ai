This video features a discussion about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity, with a focus on the impact of AI and ML on both cybercriminals and cybersecurity defense. The speakers highlight the increasing sophistication of AI-powered cyber attacks, such as deepfake audio and video used for social engineering and business email compromise (BEC) scams. However, they also emphasize the potential of AI and ML to enhance cybersecurity defense, including the ability to analyze large amounts of data in real-time, detect anomalies, and predict potential threats. The speakers stress the importance of ethical considerations in AI-powered cybersecurity, such as ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and unbiased. They also highlight future trends in AI and ML in cybersecurity, including the use of AI for threat hunting, automated incident response, and the development of AI-powered security operations centers (SOCs). Overall, the speakers emphasize the need for continued investment in AI and ML research and development in cybersecurity, as well as the importance of collaboration between industry, academia, and government to address the evolving threat landscape.","
