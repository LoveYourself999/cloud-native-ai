g7uEBNmGj-M,Coordinate Workloads Colocation: QoS-Oriented Scheduling Enhancement on K8s - Zuowei Zhang & Tao Li,Kubernetes Batch + HPC Day NA 2022,"

John has been working on a project that involves using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyze large datasets in real-time, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions more quickly and accurately. The technology combines machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision to analyze sales data, weather patterns, and economic indicators for predicting future demand and optimizing inventory levels. John identifies the sheer volume and complexity of the data as one of the biggest challenges, requiring significant computing power to process and analyze it in real-time. Looking ahead, John predicts more businesses will adopt AI and ML for data-driven decision-making, with more sophisticated algorithms for handling larger and more complex datasets and a shift towards explainable AI.","

u7htKIiK75c,"Beyond Experimental: Spark on Kubernetes - Weiwei Yang, Apple",Kubernetes Batch + HPC Day NA 2022,"

The discussion revolves around the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, focusing on the impact of AI, VR, and quantum computing. Panelists Efi Pylarinou, Meltem Demirors, and Ian Mcleod explore the evolution of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, highlighting the growing segments of stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

AI and blockchain are seen as powerful technologies that can work together to improve blockchain scalability, security, smart contracts, and data analysis. AI can help create more sophisticated smart contracts and enable better data analysis in the blockchain ecosystem. AI and blockchain together can create new applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0.

VR and blockchain can benefit from each other, with VR platforms using blockchain technology to enable true digital ownership, interoperability, and secure data transactions. Blockchain can enhance VR platforms by enabling the creation of decentralized VR marketplaces, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be used to prove ownership and authenticity in the VR space.

Quantum computing poses a potential threat to blockchain networks' cryptographic security. Post-quantum cryptography is being researched to secure blockchain networks against quantum attacks. In summary, the speakers highlight the importance of AI, VR, and quantum computing in shaping the future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.","
