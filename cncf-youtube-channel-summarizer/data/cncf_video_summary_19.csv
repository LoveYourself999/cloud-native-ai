Lcc2GJQ1PeU,"Understanding Exploitability with VEX, EPSS, and Other Standard Frameworks - Ayse Kaya, Root",GitOpsCon North America 2024,"

The presentation by Aisha from Truth discusses the importance of effective vulnerability management in the context of the rapid increase in common vulnerability exposures (CVEs). With the number of CVEs growing exponentially, decision-making should be prioritized through prioritization. Key topics and technologies mentioned include CVEs, the npm ecosystem, third-party packages, recursive self-improvement AI, vendor-specific CVEs, and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

Significant conclusions include the necessity of prioritization for effective vulnerability management and the role of AI as both a tool and a potential threat for security teams. Additionally, understanding the context of vulnerabilities is crucial, and a dynamic inventory of software components and their vulnerabilities is essential for effective vulnerability management. Vex statements, which tie the software bill of materials to vulnerability information, can help organizations better understand the impact of vulnerabilities on their software.

Future trends involve AI agents generating their own code, creating both opportunities and challenges for security teams, and the need for organizations to maintain an up-to-date understanding of their software components and their vulnerabilities.","
