_a8fxJDzCJU,"Sidecar Containers Are Built-in to Kubernetes: What, How, and Why Now?- Todd Neal & Sergey Kanzhelev",KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2023,"

The presentation focused on Kubernetes sidecars, which are a pattern for implementing workloads where an application is deployed in a container and needs to communicate with other components for tasks like collecting telemetry, accessing the network, managing security, and accessing data. Sidecars are designed to address the issue of sidecars steering the main container, and they were initially designed for web apps where the sidecar and main container run in parallel and share resources.

However, sidecars have limitations in terms of termination order and graceful termination, which are important for long-running jobs. The Kubernetes community has addressed these issues by experimenting with and implementing new features, such as termination ordering and new workload types like AI/ML, HPC, and hardware management.

Sidecars are implemented as init containers with a restart policy of 'always', and termination ordering is more complicated: pre-stop hooks are called simultaneously for main containers and sidecars, and the sidecars are not stopped until all main containers have completed. This allows for dependencies between main containers and sidecars.

When using sidecars, it is essential to consider requests and limits, minimize the time before containers go ready, and exit pre-stop hooks as soon as possible. Metrics and cost accounting tools should also be updated to account for sidecars.

Future features that may be added to sidecars include security boundaries, resource reuse, better OOM handling, and percentage of usage.

Overall, the presentation provided a clear overview of Kubernetes sidecars, their limitations, and future features. The speakers also highlighted the importance of termination ordering and graceful termination for long-running jobs.","

4mYUyAeyr-U,"The Cluster Killer Bug: Learning API Priority and Fairness the Hard Way - Eddie Zaneski, Independent",KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2023,"
The video shares lessons learned from a team that increased Kubernetes (k8s) cluster sizes and concurrency limits, revealing unexpected issues related to the GKE dashboard and API token permissions. The presentation emphasizes the importance of testing new features, reading documentation, and providing feedback to developers, as well as the need for more community members to test and provide feedback on knobs and features. Key open issues include a bug related to 429s (Too Many Requests) and 504s (Gateway Timeout), with a plan for further investigation. Overall, the team stresses the importance of understanding logs and metrics, slowing down to analyze issues, and looking at historical and change log data to resolve problems.","

ecx-yp4g7YU,"The Complexity on Scaling ML Pipelines on Kubernetes Using Tekton - Tommy Li, IBM",KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2023,"
IBM uses Tecton Pipelines, an open-source Kubernetes-native CI/CD system for building and managing ML pipelines, on OpenShift. Tecton Pipelines allows for conditionals, custom controllers, and sharing of parameters and metadata. IBM collaborated with the Tecton community to add features such as error handling, standard API definitions, and a custom task system. These enhancements address limitations in the initial implementation, including the lack of caching, garbage collection, and customizable termination logic. IBM uses Tecton Pipelines on OpenShift as the foundation for their ML infrastructure.","

3U_qoCCZyNk,Rapidly Scaling for Breaking News with Karpenter and KEDA - Mel Cone & Deepak Goel,KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2023,"

The discussion revolves around managing and scaling Kubernetes clusters during breaking news events, focusing on a shared platform and infrastructure. The number of nodes in a cluster during these events is significant, but not explicitly stated. Managed nodes, such as AWS Fargate, are used for Ingress controller workloads, but not for other workloads in the cluster, which are managed through different node groups. The main focus is on providing a clear, responsive, and easy-to-use platform for users, minimizing their need to handle infrastructure issues.
