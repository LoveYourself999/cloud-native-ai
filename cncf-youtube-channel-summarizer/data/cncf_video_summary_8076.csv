Remote collaboration is being transformed by virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, enabling immersive environments for real-time interaction and 3D content sharing. Holoportation is an example of such a platform, allowing users to teleport as holograms into shared virtual spaces for life-like, face-to-face interactions. Volumetric video, which captures 3D video of real-world scenes and objects, further enriches the collaboration experience by bringing physical objects into the virtual space. Potential applications include architecture, design, manufacturing, remote surgeries, and medical training. Challenges remain, such as network latency, security, and privacy concerns, but advancements in technology and infrastructure are expected to address these issues.","
