THT1jabtCdI,"What's New in gRPC - Kevin Nilson & Gina Yeh, Google; Richard Belleville, Independent",KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2023,"
The video is a presentation on gRPC, an open-source high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. The presenter discusses the benefits of using gRPC, including its performance, scalability, and flexibility in building distributed systems. They also highlight the use of protocol buffers as the default serialization format in gRPC, providing efficient and reliable data transfer between services.
The presenter emphasizes the importance of community feedback in improving gRPC and encourages the audience to reach out with their thoughts and suggestions. Overall, the presentation underscores the value of using gRPC as a powerful tool in building modern, distributed systems that can handle the demands of today's digital world.
Key Technologies:
- gRPC: an open-source high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google.
- Protocol Buffers: a language-neutral data serialization format developed by Google, used as the default serialization format in gRPC.
Critical Questions/Answers:
- Q: How can users provide feedback to improve gRPC?
- A: Users can reach out to the gRPC community through the mailing list or Twitter to provide feedback and suggestions.","

RggqaCSdOGA,What's New with Kubectl and Kustomize â€¦ and How You Can Help!,KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2023,"
The speakers discuss the potential for using Kubernetes to create standardized developer environments, addressing the challenges of customizing individual developer environments on laptops or self-provided machines. They propose using a bootstrap script, named ""L"", to initialize a standardized environment and explore the idea of implementing a system similar to Unix, with system-wide and user-specific directories for customization. The main conclusion is the potential for using ""L"" to create consistent developer environments in Kubernetes, with future trends including expanding the bootstrap script's capabilities and exploring the use of directories in Kubernetes. Key technologies mentioned include Kubernetes, Unix systems, and user directories.","
