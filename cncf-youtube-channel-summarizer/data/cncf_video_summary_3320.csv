Z9qnMd7hVOo,"Welcome + Opening Remarks - Suzanne Daniels, Spotify & Martina Iglesias Fernandez, Roadie",BackstageCon NA 2022,"

Dr. Sarah Mitchell and Dr. Tom O'Brien discuss the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in healthcare. Key topics include AI-powered diagnostic tools that analyze medical images, ML algorithms predicting patient outcomes, and AI improving clinical workflows, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans.

Two noteworthy AI and ML projects in healthcare are AI-powered virtual nursing assistants and ML algorithms analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients at risk of developing certain conditions.

Challenges in implementing AI and ML in healthcare include lack of standardization and interoperability in healthcare data, insufficient data quality and quantity, difficulty in explaining AI and ML decision-making processes, and potential ethical concerns.

Addressing these challenges requires collaboration among stakeholders, improving data quality and quantity, addressing explainability concerns with transparent and interpretable models, and addressing ethical concerns by involving a diverse group of stakeholders in decision-making processes.","
