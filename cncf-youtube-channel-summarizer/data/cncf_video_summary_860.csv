OvLHzfMig-k,"Keynote: Hot Dog! The Technical Oversight... - Duffie, Ricardo, Alolita, Pushkar, Catherine",KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2023,"
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is responsible for evaluating projects for inclusion in the CNCF and supporting them once they are part of the foundation. The TOC is supported by Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) that focus on different domains such as security, contributor strategy, and observability. The TOC is working on automating the gathering of information about project health and re-evaluating the existing maturity level structure. TOC members and leaders of TAGs discussed their involvement and the rewards of their work, as well as collaboration in working groups such as the Deen heart of hearing working group.

Key technologies mentioned include cloud native computing, technical advisory groups, and working groups. The main topics discussed are the work of the TOC and TAGs, the automation of information gathering, and collaboration in working groups. The speakers highlight the rewarding nature of their work and the importance of collaboration in the CNCF ecosystem.

The Kubernetes Multicluster SIG at CNCF North America 2023 focuses on enabling use cases for multiple clusters, such as exposing workloads and sharing metadata between them. The Sig aims to identify core primitives and semantics for describing multicluster scenarios without imposing specific implementations. Key projects include a new website, cluster set, an API for metadata (the About API), multicluster services, and building blocks for orchestration in the multicluster space. The Sig encourages participation from diverse backgrounds and can be engaged with through the website at multicluster.doig.io.","
