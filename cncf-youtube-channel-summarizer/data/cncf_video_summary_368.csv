IW46dt_JrE4,Kubernetes Chronicles: Stories of Triumph in Kubernetes Support - Roman Doroschevici & Sian Meoli,KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024,"

The video covers Kubernetes support at Google Cloud, with a focus on the seven most common features of Kubernetes-related cases in 2023, as discussed by Roman, a Technical Solutions engineer at Google. The top features include networking, node-related issues, control plane issues, and more.

Networking is the main trend in Kubernetes support cases, as microservices require communication between each other. Node-related issues often involve node stability, resource allocation, or node failures. Control plane issues include problems with components like Qi server, controller manager, and etcd, which can affect scheduling and orchestration.

A real-life case is presented where a customer couldn't create GKE clusters due to a certificate signed by an unknown authority. The issue was resolved by regenerating the Kubeconfig and using the correct certificate authority for the API server. Providing detailed information in support cases can help resolve issues more efficiently.

Overall, the summary highlights the importance of understanding common issues in Kubernetes support and the need for clear communication in resolving these issues.","

XffdYT5SH6Y,Deploying with Confidence: Lessons Learned Navigating Deployments of a 100-Strong Development Team,KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024,"

This discussion focuses on the use of a continuous delivery platform for deploying software updates in a secure and efficient manner. The platform supports various deployment strategies, including blue-green, canary, and shadowing, and allows users to easily switch between these strategies. The speakers emphasize that while users are not limited to these strategies, they have been the most common choices among users.

The platform also includes built-in testing and quality control measures, such as automated unit and integration tests, as well as load testing using k6. If any tests fail, the build is marked as bad and is not promoted to the next channel. Additionally, human reviewers can manually mark a build as bad if they detect any issues.

Another key aspect of the platform is the use of feature toggles, which allow for more fine-grained control over feature releases. Feature toggles can be defined at different levels of maturity and can have designated toggle owners to manage their lifecycle.

Overall, the continuous delivery platform provides a robust and flexible solution for deploying software updates, with built-in testing and quality control measures and fine-grained control over feature releases.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS/ANSWERS:

* How do you test the quality of the software before it gets into production?
	+ Automated unit and integration tests are run on each instance. If these tests fail, the build is marked as bad and is not promoted to the next channel. Human reviewers can also manually mark a build as bad if they detect any issues.
* How do you decide the future toggle owner or how do you assign that or how do you manage that?
	+ The speakers did not provide specific recommendations for deciding the future toggle owner or assigning that role. They emphasized the importance of having a designated toggle owner to manage the lifecycle of feature toggles.","

Q2GuTUO170w,"Sharing Is Caring: GPU Sharing and CDI in Device Plugins - Evan Lezar, NVIDIA & David Porter, Google",KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024,"
GPU sharing and CDI (Container Device Interface) are crucial in managing devices in Kubernetes. Three GPU sharing methods were discussed: MPS (Multi-Process Service), MIG (Multi-Instance GPU), and a third unnamed method. MPS allows for concurrent applications on a GPU with predefined partitioning and shared fault domains. MIG offers dynamic resource sharing with performance and memory isolation and no shared fault domains, but is only available on newer GPUs. The unnamed method combines the best of both, allowing dynamic resource sharing with performance and memory isolation and no shared fault domains on specific GPU models. The choice of GPU sharing method depends on the use case and available GPUs.

KEY TECHNOLOGIES:
- MPS (Multi-Process Service)
- MIG (Multi-Instance GPU)
- CDI (Container Device Interface)
- Kubernetes

MAIN TOPICS:
- GPU sharing methods: MPS, MIG, and an unnamed method
- Resource partitioning and allocation
- Performance and memory isolation
- Shared fault domains
- Device management in Kubernetes using CDI

CRITICAL QUESTIONS/ANSWERS:
- Q: What are the downsides of MPS?
- A: MPS has static partitioning and shared fault domains.
- Q: What are the advantages of MIG?
- A: MIG offers dynamic resource sharing, performance and memory isolation, and no shared fault domains.
- Q: What are the limitations of MIG?
- A: MIG is only available on newer GPUs and requires upfront partitioning.
- Q: What are the advantages of the unnamed method?
- A: The unnamed method combines the best of both MPS and MIG.

FUTURE TRENDS:
The presentation highlights the importance of GPU sharing and device management in Kubernetes. Future trends include more advanced GPU sharing methods, improved device management tools, and increased adoption of Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.","
