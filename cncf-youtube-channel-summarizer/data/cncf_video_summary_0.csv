BoNrIx93vZE,Create a First AI Program with TypeScript and Serverless WebAssembly,KCD Los Angeles 2024,"

The presentation focuses on building a chatbot using Spin, a web assembly-based framework for building applications. The speakers discuss the use of pre-built components and custom components to create a chatbot experience. They also discuss the use of SQLite and vector databases for generating embeddings, which can be used to provide more context to the language model. The speakers mention the use of Langchain for indexing and retrieving information.

The presentation includes a live coding session where they demonstrate how to generate embeddings and insert them into a SQLite database. However, they encounter some issues with the SQLite query, which they plan to address in a follow-up session.

Overall, the presentation highlights the potential of using Spin for building chatbots and the importance of using context to improve language model performance. The speakers emphasize the use of documentation and other resources for learning more about Spin and its capabilities.","

3sgPJJTstoA,"Stop using kubectl, and use Git instead! - Hands-on GitOps workshop using Argo CD and Helm",KCD Los Angeles 2024,"

The speakers led a workshop on Argo CD, a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. They discussed various features of Argo CD, including managing stateful workloads, handling upgrades, and using operators and application sets for managing applications. They also demonstrated using Argo CD with other Argo tools such as Argo Rollouts and Argo Events.

One of the main topics discussed was managing application dependencies in Argo CD. The speakers showed how to use Argo CD's application dependencies feature to manage dependencies between applications. They also discussed the limitations of this feature and possible solutions for managing complex dependencies.

Another key technology mentioned was GitOps, a set of practices that emphasize using Git as the source of truth for managing infrastructure and applications. The speakers discussed how Argo CD implements GitOps, allowing developers to manage Kubernetes applications using Git.

One critical question that arose during the workshop was how to manage complex application dependencies in Argo CD. The speakers acknowledged this challenge and suggested possible solutions, such as using operators and application sets. However, they also noted that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and that different approaches may be necessary depending on the specific use case.

In summary, the workshop provided a deep dive into Argo CD and its features for managing Kubernetes applications. The speakers discussed various techniques for using Argo CD effectively, including managing application dependencies and integrating with other Argo tools. They also highlighted the importance of GitOps and how Argo CD implements this approach for managing infrastructure and applications.","
