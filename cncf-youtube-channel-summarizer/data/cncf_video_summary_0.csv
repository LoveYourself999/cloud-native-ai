BoNrIx93vZE,Create a First AI Program with TypeScript and Serverless WebAssembly,KCD Los Angeles 2024,"
The speakers present a demonstration of building a simple JSON API using the Spin framework, which enables the creation of web applications with various languages. The API utilizes a generative AI model to generate responses based on user input. Key technologies and concepts discussed include the Spin framework, routes, and the use of key-value stores and caching to improve application performance. The speakers also touch on the benefits of using web assembly for functions as a service, such as security, performance, and portability. They address audience questions about troubleshooting and debugging, as well as demonstrate the use of external databases and custom host implementations. The presentation includes live demonstrations of deploying applications to the cloud, using a GPU for inference, and caching responses in a key-value store.

The speakers share their experience working with the Spin SDK and the GCP SDK, showcasing examples of spin applications that generate embeddings for URLs and text to perform vector similarity searches. They offer to help the audience with their specific problems and provide feedback on their spin applications.","

3sgPJJTstoA,"Stop using kubectl, and use Git instead! - Hands-on GitOps workshop using Argo CD and Helm",KCD Los Angeles 2024,"

The main focus of the presentation is introducing Argo CD, a declarative, GitOps continuous Delivery tool for Kubernetes, and demonstrating its features through a hands-on workshop. Key technologies mentioned include Kubernetes, Helm, Argo CD command-line interface, kubectl, and Git.

The presenter highlights Argo CD's user interface, which provides detailed information about the tasks being performed by the application, such as get clone, applying manifests, and completing the manifests application. The UI also allows users to view the history of applications.

The workshop covers installing Argo CD via Helm, creating a new Dev cluster, connecting to the cluster, copying and pasting the token into the terminal, creating a new application in the platform portal, adding a repository, and providing a name for the application. The presenter also mentions the use of a dev container that includes Argo CD command-line interface, Helm, kubectl, Git, and other necessary tools.

Overall, the presentation emphasizes the ease of use of Argo CD and its ability to provide detailed information about the tasks being performed by the application, making it a valuable tool for declarative, GitOps Continuous Delivery in Kubernetes.","
