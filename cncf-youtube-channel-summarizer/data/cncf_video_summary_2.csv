PNILXc3YDPQ,Workshop:  Hands-on Kubernetes,KCD Los Angeles 2024,"

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It is built on a set of controllers that repeatedly ask the API if there are any pods not scheduled on nodes, and if so, schedule them. The architecture of Kubernetes is centered around the API, the etcd store, and the controllers, with the API being the only thing allowed to touch the etcd store.

Key Kubernetes objects include:
- Pod: a set of containers sharing the same network stack, with one main container and potentially ancillary containers.
- Deployment: an API concept for scaling out pods, creating a group of pods that can run across nodes.
- Service: a way to route traffic into pods, with kubernetes taking care of routing traffic into the pod's containers.

Kubernetes is managed through the CLI, using the pattern `kubectl [verb] [optional name] [optional flags]`, with YAML used to specify the desired state of resources. It is not a platform, but rather a set of Lego bricks that can be used to build platforms, and is the new operating system for the cloud, meeting developers halfway and normalizing the cloud.

The presentation also notes that there are many other Kubernetes objects and tools not covered in the presentation, such as endpoints, nodes, pod templates, secrets, service accounts, stateful sets, advanced secret management, and CNIs.","

The speakers present Sepia (SEPH), a distributed storage system that provides block, object, and file storage in one unified system, which is used in Kubernetes environments with the rook CSI driver. SEPH is flexible and can be deployed in various environments, including OpenStack, hyper-converged, and non-hyper-converged setups. It consumes any storage devices and integrates the uid mapper into the kernel. SEPH allows users to act as a particular uid and map inside the SEPH fs and other layers.

Training is available for using SEPH, and it provides features like user quotas and snapshots. The system is designed to be highly flexible, and it can be deployed in different environments with various tools and technologies. SEPH is not restricted to specific hardware or operating systems and can be run on previously used or expired systems for environmental benefits.

When sharing a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) across multiple namespaces, sharing with NFS is easier due to the complexity of sharing with the native CFS CSI driver. SEPH consumes all available drives on each node as OSDs and deploys RADOS Gateways. The speakers demonstrate creating a user and a bucket in the RADOS Gateway, showing how SEPH can be used with NFS and how it can consume all the space on the OSDs when creating a file system.

In summary, the video highlights the flexibility of SEPH, its ability to be deployed in various environments, and its integration with various tools and technologies, making it an attractive storage solution for diverse use cases.","
