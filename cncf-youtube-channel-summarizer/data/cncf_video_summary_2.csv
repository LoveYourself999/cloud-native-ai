PNILXc3YDPQ,Workshop:  Hands-on Kubernetes,KCD Los Angeles 2024,"

The main topic of this presentation is Kubernetes architecture, focusing on its core concepts and components. Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system, uses a control plane made up of etcd, a distributed key-value store for storing state, the scheduler for workload placement, and the cloud controller manager for managing cloud providers. The API, which is RESTful and well-documented, is built on top of these components, enabling communication between Kubernetes and various tools, languages, and interfaces.

Several key objects in the Kubernetes API are discussed, including namespaces, deployments, and services. Namespaces help organize resources, teams, and resource usage. Deployments manage stateless replicas of applications, enabling rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling. Services provide stable IP addresses and DNS names for accessing deployments and other workloads, while also handling load balancing and traffic routing.

The presenter briefly touches upon the idea that Kubernetes can manage stateful workloads, but does not delve into details. A potential future trend for Kubernetes is its increasing adoption in managing stateful workloads in addition to stateless ones. This would enable Kubernetes to be a more comprehensive platform for managing various types of applications and services.

While the presenter does not address critical questions, a potential question to consider is the complexity of managing Kubernetes, given the numerous components and objects involved. This could be a challenge for teams new to container orchestration, but various tools and resources are available to help ease the learning curve.","

The speakers discuss Ceph's unified storage system, focusing on three services: Rados (block storage), RGW (object storage), and SEFS (file system). These services share the same underlying storage infrastructure, relying on Rados' data replication, data placement, data repair, and data rebalancing. They explain how to build a highly available architecture using Ceph's replication mechanisms asynchronously and synchronously for disaster recovery and load balancing purposes. The speakers also introduce the RBD mirror demon for synchronous and asynchronous replication, emphasizing its usage for load balancing and disaster recovery.

In summary, the main topics discussed revolve around Ceph's unified storage system, its three primary services, and replication techniques for disaster recovery and load balancing. The key technologies mentioned are Rados, RGW, SEFS, RBD, and RBD mirror demon. The speakers emphasize the benefits of using Ceph's storage system, such as data replication, repair, and rebalancing, making it an attractive choice for various storage needs.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

Q: What are the differences between asynchronous and synchronous replication in Ceph?
A: Asynchronous replication is slower than RBD replication but more resilient, while synchronous replication is faster but limited by the slowest OSD. Additionally, asynchronous replication requires tracking object history, while synchronous replication requires a separate pool and the RBD mirror demon to run.

Q: How do Ceph's metadata servers (MDS) handle different clients accessing different data?
A: Ceph's MDS can handle different clients accessing different data, provided they have the correct permissions to read the data. Similarly, clients and MDS can handle different data in different file systems.

Q: How does Ceph handle losing a metadata server or an OSD?
A: Losing a metadata server or OSD does not cause major issues, as new ones can be replaced and added to the cluster. The MDS will automatically recreate the journal and replay it if a metadata server is lost. Similarly, an OSD can be replaced with a new one.","
