Thank you for that introduction. I'm delighted to be here today to discuss the current state and future trends of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have come a long way in recent years, and we are now seeing them being used in a wide variety of applications, from self-driving cars to medical diagnosis.

One of the key technologies driving these advancements is deep learning, which is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Deep learning has enabled us to make significant progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Another important technology is reinforcement learning, which is a type of machine learning that involves training agents to take actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning has been used to train agents to play complex games, such as Go and chess, and has also been applied to robotics and autonomous systems.

Looking to the future, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in AI and ML. One area that is particularly promising is the integration of AI and ML with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing. This will enable us to create more intelligent and responsive systems that can interact with the physical world in real-time.

Another area of interest is the development of explainable AI, which is the ability to provide clear and understandable explanations for the decisions made by AI systems. This is important because it will help to build trust in AI and ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly.

In conclusion, artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming the way we live and work, and we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the future. Thank you for your attention.
